# Exercise 01-02: Multiple Outputs

## Background

This exercise helps you practice using multiple `Console.WriteLine()` statements and understanding how programs execute line by line.

## Instructions

Create a C# console application that displays a simple story or description using multiple output statements.

## Requirements

1. Use at least 5 `Console.WriteLine()` statements
2. Create a short story, poem, or description of your day
3. Each line should be a complete sentence or phrase
4. The output should make sense when read together
5. Use proper C# syntax throughout

## Expected Output

Your program should produce output similar to this example:

```
Today I woke up early.
The sun was shining brightly.
I had breakfast with my family.
Then I went to school.
Programming class was my favorite part of the day!
```

## Hints

- Each `Console.WriteLine()` statement creates a new line
- You can create any story you want - be creative!
- Remember that the computer executes statements in order from top to bottom
- Don't forget semicolons after each statement

## Getting Started

1. Create a new console application:
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n MultipleOutputs
   cd MultipleOutputs
   ```

2. Open `Program.cs` in your editor

3. Replace the existing code with your story

4. Run your program:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Testing Your Solution

Your program should:
- Compile without errors
- Display at least 5 lines of output
- Tell a coherent story or description
- Use proper C# syntax
- Execute statements in the correct order
