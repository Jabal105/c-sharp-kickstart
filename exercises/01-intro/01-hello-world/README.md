# Exercise 01-01: Hello World

## Background

This exercise helps you practice creating and running your first C# program. You'll modify the basic Hello World program to display personalized information.

## Instructions

Create a C# console application that displays information about yourself.

## Requirements

1. Display a greeting with your name
2. Display your age or grade level
3. Display what you hope to learn in this programming course
4. Use proper C# syntax with semicolons and correct capitalization

## Expected Output

Your program should produce output similar to this (with your own information):

```
Hello, my name is Anna!
I am 17 years old.
I hope to learn how to create games and websites.
```

## Hints

- Use `Console.WriteLine()` to display each line
- Remember to put text in double quotes
- Each statement should end with a semicolon
- Make sure to use proper capitalization for `Console.WriteLine`

## Getting Started

1. Create a new console application:
   ```bash
   dotnet new console -n HelloWorld
   cd HelloWorld
   ```

2. Open `Program.cs` in your editor

3. Replace the existing code with your personalized version

4. Run your program:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Testing Your Solution

Your program should:
- Compile without errors
- Display three lines of output
- Show your personal information
- Use proper C# syntax
